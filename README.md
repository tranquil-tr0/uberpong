Very sory for no server but the wifi was too slow to upload to nest

To run, you need to (a) run the server, and (b) open the webpage

### To run the server

`cd backend`
`cargo run`

### To run the dev server

`cd front`
`pnpm install`
`pnpm run dev`

Then navigate to `http://localhost:5173/` to open the webpage.
You can open many tabs and they will all run on the server you just ran.
